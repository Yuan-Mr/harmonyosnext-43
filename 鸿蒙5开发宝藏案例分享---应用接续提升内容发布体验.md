### 🌟【Development Experience Sharing】HarmonyOS Application Continuation Function Battle Practice: These Hidden Cases Help You Achieve Smooth Cross-Device Transition!  

Hello, fellow developers! Today, while working on a project, I accidentally unlocked a "treasure skill" of HarmonyOS—the application continuation function! In fact, the official documentation hides many practical cases, but many colleagues may not have noticed them. As someone who has stumbled through countless pitfalls, I'll break down the core cross-device continuation development skills for you!  


### 📱 I. Let's First Talk About How Awesome This Function Is  
Imagine this scenario: you're editing a Xiaohongshu post on your phone and suddenly want to switch to a tablet to continue typesetting. Just tap the tablet's Dock bar icon, and the draft seamlessly transfers with all images and text! This sci-fi-like experience can be achieved in minutes using HarmonyOS's distributed capabilities!  
(悄悄说：In testing, it can even achieve the cool operation of taking a photo on your phone and directly inserting it on a tablet)  


### 🔧 II. Three Core Points of Development  
Remember these three must-haves—missing any one will cause failure:  
1️⃣ Log in to the same Huawei account on both devices  
2️⃣ Wi-Fi + Bluetooth enabled (recommended in the same local area network)  
3️⃣ Settings → Multi-Device Coordination → Turn on the continuation function switch  


### 📝 III. Detailed Explanation of Practical Cases (with Pitfall Prevention Guide)  
#### 🌟 Case 1: Cross-Device Continuation of Image-Text Drafts  
```typescript  
// Explanation of core code snippets  
async onContinue(wantParam: Record<string, Object>) {  
  // Generate a distributed session ID (as important as an express tracking number!)  
  let sessionId = distributedDataObject.genSessionId(); 
  
  // Convert the image to an ArrayBuffer and store it in the distributed directory  
  const buffer = await imageToArrayBuffer(pickedImage);  
  writeDistributedFile(buffer, 'travel_photo.jpg');  
  
  // Create a data object to wrap all content  
  this.distributedObject = distributedDataObject.create(this.context, {  
    title: '西藏旅行日记',  
    content: '布达拉宫真的太震撼了...',  
    images: [distributedAsset] // Key! Here goes the distributed file reference  
  });  
  
  // Activate data synchronization (equivalent to starting a data express service)  
  this.distributedObject.setSessionId(sessionId);  
  await this.distributedObject.save(targetDevice);  
}  
```  
💡 Pitfall: Images must be converted to distributed assets—transferring local paths directly will fail!  

#### 🌟 Case 2: Real-Time Continuation of Collaborative Documents  
When users switch from PC to mobile, rich text needs processing:  
```typescript  
// When restoring data on the receiving end  
if (status === 'restored') {  
  // Get the document version number from the distributed object  
  const version = this.distributedObject['docVersion'];  
  
  // Conflict handling: prompt users if local modifications exist  
  if(localVersion > version) {  
    showAlert('检测到版本冲突，请选择保留版本');  
  }  
  
  // Restore document content (including format data)  
  quillEditor.setContents(this.distributedObject['delta']);  
}  
```  
✨ Extended skill: Use the JSON diff algorithm for incremental synchronization to reduce data transmission.  

#### 🌟 Case 3: Contact List Continuation  
Optimizing the migration of contact avatars:  
```typescript  
// Image processing optimization scheme  
async compressImageForTransfer(pixelMap) {  
  // Dynamically compress based on device type  
  const targetDevice = getTargetDeviceType();  
  const quality = targetDevice === 'phone' ? 0.8 : 1.0;  
  
  // Use HarmonyOS native compression API  
  const packOpts: image.PackingOption = { format: 'image/jpeg', quality };  
  return await imageSource.createPixelMap(packOpts);  
}  
```  
Test data: Using the dynamic compression strategy increases transmission speed by 40%.  


### 🔍 IV. Must-See Secrets for Debugging  
1. Use DevEco Studio's distributed simulator (real-device debugging is even better)  
2. View hilog logs and filter by the keyword "distributed"  
3. When synchronization fails, first check: Is Bluetooth enabled? Have distributed file permissions been granted?  


### 🎯 V. Did You Think That's All? Here Are More Cool Operations  
● Combine AI capabilities to achieve intelligent recommendations for continued content  
● Use device sensor status to determine the best continuation timing  
● Data shard transmission in multi-device relay scenarios  


### Final Thoughts  
At first, the official documentation was indeed confusing, but when the first continuation demo ran successfully, the excitement of "Wow, it actually works!" was amazing! I hope this sharing helps you avoid detours. If you have other cool operations, welcome to battle in the comments~ Next time, let's talk about how to use HarmonyOS to achieve cross-device game state synchronization.
